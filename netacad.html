                        <p>During a networking lab, it was recommended to us that to learn more about networking it would beneficial to do an online course on the Internet of Things (IoT). Hosted by Cisco’s Network Academy (Netacad), the course was estimated at 20 hours to complete and covered the basics of networking and IoT.</p>
                        <p>Netacad is an educational program from Cisco that offers a wide range of free online courses aimed at training people on subjects such as hardware, software and networking.</p>

                    <div class="textColumn"> 
                        <p>To complete the course required downloading software for various lab exercises created by Netacad. One such piece of software is Cisco’s Packet Tracer; a program designed to simulate real life networks and is often used for testing purposes.</p>

                        <p>Not only did this give me 10 hours’ worth of CPD it definitely benefited me in terms of advancing my networking knowledge. As well as this, I also have become familiar with Packet Tracer and other software I used during the course, which will make any work in future that uses these programs easier.</p>
