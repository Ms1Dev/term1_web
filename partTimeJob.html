                        <p>Since February of this year (2021), I have been working at a company that develops CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems and have been part of several projects including one from its inception. I am contracted to 16 hours a week and it has been challenging to work and study simultaneously; but I am learning a lot about time management and it is also extremely beneficial to have a job relevant to my course. </p>

                        <p>The project I am working on currently is for an employment agency in Saudi Arabia. This has presented interesting challenges as the system needs to be in Arabic and optionally English; one reason why this is so challenging is when the system is in arabic the content needs to be shown from right to left.</p>

                    <div class="textColumn">
                        <p>The main programming language I use at work is called Casemaster 2.0, it is a language that has been created by the company to efficiently develop CRM systems. As it is not a well-known language it does not directly contribute to my studying; however, it still requires good coding practices and because the CRMs are accessed through web browsers the experienced gained with the front-end development of the systems has helped me with web development.</p>
