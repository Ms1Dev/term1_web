                        <p>Starting University can be a strange and slightly daunting experience; so to assist with new students settling in, the university assigns two CERT (Collaborative Engagement and Retention Team) mentors to each tutor group. After meeting our CERT mentors in person during the first weeks of term, we have had weekly online meetings to discuss any questions or issues we have been having.</p>

                        <p>It has been comforting to hear from students who have done the same course as me and know what I am going through, it can be difficult to know who to ask for information and anything the mentors canâ€™t answer themselves they recommend the right person to go to.</p>
                        <p>Overall, I think the idea of CERT mentors is good, it has definitely improved the experience of settling in and has made me feel closer with my course mates in my tutor group. Up to this point I have attended 3 meetings online with our CERT mentors, this has provided me with 3 hours of CPD as well as the assistance I have gained from the meetings.</p>
